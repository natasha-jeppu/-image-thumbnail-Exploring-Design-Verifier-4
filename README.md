# Exploring-Design-Verifier-4
This has examples files for exploring Simulink Design Verifier

This has a set of models for the Therac-25 revisited as a Stateflow model, a 3 signal voter logic and a Up/Down counter. There is a detailed description as a PowerPoint to help understand the models. A set of NuSMV (another model checker) files is also provided for comparison.
